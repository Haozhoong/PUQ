### PUG: Phase-wise Uncertainty Guided qMRI Reconstruction
This repository provides the code for the Phase-wise Uncertainty Guided (PUG) method for quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) reconstruction. PUG leverages phase-wise uncertainty to guide the parameter fitting process, improving the accuracy of qMRI reconstruction. The method incorporates Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout) for uncertainty measurement and uses a two-stage reconstruction and fitting framework.
Features. The corresponding paper has been submitted to MICCAI 2025.
